# HTML-and-CSS-Test
### Peer graded assignment No.1 for the course "Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" by Goldsmiths University of London

This assignment is for testing HTML and CSS skills by displaying and formatting some text.

The main aim of this project is to explore different ways of using CSS to modify the how the HTML content is styled and displayed.

I created the stylesheet styles.css, which changes the style of the heading in index.html in 3 ways.

The styling was applied using:
- Media query: responsive to browser width
- Hover selector
- Font family, color, size, style, weight and variant
- Text alignment
- Background color
- Margin
